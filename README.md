My first attempt at ever building a game.  

And my first attempt at really doing something with the canvas element.

So forgive any mistakes ;)

## Installation

It's just HTML, CSS, and javascript.  Open it in a modern browser and have fun.

Too lazy to download?  [Play it on jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/PxpVr/16/embedded/result/).

## Inspiration

When I was a kid I loved to play [the old Tron game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONg0rUogiEg), so when I decided to make a game to learn the canvas element, this seem fitting.
